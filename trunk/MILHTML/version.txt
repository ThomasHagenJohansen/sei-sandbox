Date:	29th March 2004

INTRODUCTION
============

	This library produces a domain tree of a given HTML document, allowing the
developer to navigate and change the document in an methodical way. In addition
to the basic HTML production, this library can also be used to produce XHTML
documents, as it includes a full HTML 4 entity encoder.

	Included in this release is a demonstration application in VB.NET showing how to 
use the library. I hope that it is all fairly self-explanatory.
